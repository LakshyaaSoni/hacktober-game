With the [Games Development Society](https://www.uwsunion.org.uk/society/uwsgamsedevsociety/) being an educational society and all, we do have some learning outcomes for this project. First and foremost, we want this to be a collaborative project where anyone can contribute and learn the ropes of game development. By the end of the project, you'll have hopefully learned some of the following.

#### Learning Outcomes

+ Learn the ropes of Game Development with the Unity Engine
+ Using GitHub to contribute to an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) project
+ Communicate and coordinate with others to come up with ideas and foster those ideas into actual gameplay elements
